# HR-Dashboard---Tableau

**ABOUT THE PROJECT:**

"The project has been meticulously designed and implemented using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, with the primary objective of conducting a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition within the organization. Spearheaded by the Human Resources (HR) department, this initiative aims to gain valuable insights into the factors contributing to employee turnover and to inform strategic decision-making for talent retention.

Through the utilization of Tableau's robust features, the project endeavors to visualize and interpret key patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset related to employee attrition. This includes exploring various dimensions such as departmental attrition rates, tenure distribution, demographic factors, performance metrics, and any other relevant variables that may influence employee turnover.

The Tableau dashboards and visualizations crafted for this project are thoughtfully designed to provide a user-friendly interface, allowing HR professionals and stakeholders to effortlessly interact with the data. By employing intuitive charts, graphs, and drill-down functionalities, the project facilitates a deep dive into specific areas of interest, fostering a nuanced understanding of attrition dynamics.

Furthermore, the project incorporates predictive modeling and analytics within Tableau to identify potential risk factors associated with attrition. Leveraging machine learning algorithms or statistical methods, the analysis aims to unveil hidden patterns and generate predictive insights that can aid in proactive talent management strategies.

The outcomes of this project will not only empower the HR department with actionable insights but also serve as a valuable resource for organizational leaders and decision-makers. Informed by the findings, the organization can implement targeted initiatives, policies, and interventions to mitigate attrition risks and foster a more conducive work environment for employee satisfaction and retention.

In summary, the Tableau-based analysis of employee attrition undertaken by the HR department stands as a testament to the organization's commitment to data-driven decision-making, aiming to enhance overall workforce management strategies and contribute to the long-term success and stability of the organization."


**INSIGHT RESULTS:**

In this Tableau dashboard project, the HR department can effectively track employee attrition using filters such as department and education level. The dashboard provides detailed insights, allowing HR professionals to delve into specific areas and gather nuanced information. This comprehensive view aids in crafting strategic retention strategies based on a deeper understanding of attrition dynamics within the organization.

1. Employee Count
2. Attrition Count
3. Attrition Rate
4. Active Employee
5. Average Age of Employee
6. Department wise attrition
7. Number of employee and their age wise attrition
8. Job satisfaction and their ratings
9. Education wise attrition
10. Attrition rate by gender for different age group

The project involved creating dedicated sheets in Tableau for each aspect of employee attrition, including department-wise and education-wise breakdowns. These sheets were meticulously merged to form a comprehensive dashboard. The background, designed in PowerPoint, was saved as a PNG image for aesthetic appeal. This approach combines in-depth analysis with a visually engaging design, providing HR professionals with a powerful and user-friendly tool for strategic decision-making.

**DATA USED:**

I used freely available sample data in Excel format from the internet for this project. Analyzing the data guided the design of the Tableau dashboard, focusing on actionable insights. This real-world sample data approach ensures relevance and credibility, providing valuable information for effective HR decision-making.
